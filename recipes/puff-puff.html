        <p>Puff puff is a deep-fried dough. They are made from yeast dough, shaped 
           into balls and deep-fried until golden brown. It has a doughnut-like texture 
           but slightly more chewy. It is a very common snack eaten by so many countries 
           but with different names and a little bit of variation in the mode of preparation.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups flour</li>
        <li>1¼ cups Water</li>
        <li>2 Teaspoons Yeast</li>
        <li>1 Teaspoon Nutmeg</li>
        <li>½ Teaspoon Salt</li>
        <li>¼ Cup Sugar + 1 teaspoon sugar for proofing the yeast</li>
        <li>Enough Oil for deep frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Mix half of a cup of warm water, 1 teaspoon of sugar and the yeast in a bowl. 
            Cover with a lid and set aside until the yeast becomes bubbly. About 4-6 minutes.</li>
        <li>In another bowl, mix the dry ingredients - Flour, Sugar, Salt, and Nutmeg.</li>
        <li>Pour the proofed yeast and the remainng one cup water together with the dry 
            ingredients and mix until the batter is lump-free.</li>
        <li>Cover the dough and allow it to rise for 1 hour. (The risen dough has a distinct 
            sweet smell, which will make you know the dough is ready for frying)</li>
        <li>Preheat the oil in a pan deep and wide enough to accomodate the puff puff balls 
            (about 360°F ) and scoop a little bit of dough and drop the batter by spoonfuls into the oil.</li>
        <li>Fry both sides until golden brown. If you are finding it hard to turn the puff puff while frying 
            you can just press down the balls a little bit with your frying spoon before turning it.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat. Drain on a paper towel and enjoy while still hot or warm</li>
    </ul>
