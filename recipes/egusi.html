        <p>Egusi is a West African name for the seeds of plants like squash, melons, and gourds that,
           when dried and ground become a staple ingredient in many West African dishes.  Particularly,
           in Nigerian culture, egusi is popular with pounded yam. These seeds are rich in fat and protein, 
           and add these essential nutrients into West African Cuisine.</p>
